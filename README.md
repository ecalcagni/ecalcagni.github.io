A website made in APCSA to demonstrate the power of JS.
(Description below is from like a year ago)
A quick website made for APCSP. This website is likely not coded well to any standard, but it works. This project did not require a ton of brainstorming, since I always thought it would be cool to make a website. This project was mostly just a reason for me to finally to actually do it. At first it was just HTML, but it quickly because HTML/CSS/JS.
